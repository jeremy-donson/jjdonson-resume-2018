<p style={{ textIndent: '5%'}}>In recent years, I have been an on-site consultant as hands-on technical lead for time-sensitive projects.
This has been extremely challenging, both technically as well as in terms of coordinating team efforts.
There have been some interesting benefits to being a hired ninja and supporting large efforts to
confront technical debt at very large companies. 
However, now I am seeking a full-time salaried role to which I can commit for years and work with teams to be built for the future.
In fact, I have been aching for a full-time role for quite a while, and will be extremely loyal to my next employer.
Most crucial for me is the company culture and the technical team dynamic, as I am extremely collaborative.</p>
